# flwr-contributions: An implementation of Federated Learning contribution methods for the Flower framework

This work was used in my paper "On the Volatility of Shapley-Based Contribution Metrics in Federated Learning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08044), to be presented at IJCNN 2025 in July.

To run the tests, make sure to install all dependancies (in pyproject.toml).
